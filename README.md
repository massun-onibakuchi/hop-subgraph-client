# Hop Protocol Subgraph Client

üõ† An JavaScript Subgraph Client for Hop Protocol

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS. Anyone can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, making data easily accessible.

[Hop Protocol](https://hop.exchange/) is a scalable rollup-to-rollup general token bridge. It allows users to send tokens from one rollup or sidechain to another almost immediately without having to wait for the networks challenge period.

## üíÅGetting Started

### ‚ú®To use Hop Subgraph Clients :

Install the lib using npm or yarn

```bash
yarn add hop-subgraph-client
```

---

## ‚ú®Subgraph Queries

```typescript
import { createSubgraphClient } from 'hop-subgraph-client'
const SUBGRAPH_URL = 'https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/hop-protocol/hop-mainnet'
const client = createSubgraphClient(SUBGRAPH_URL)
```

#### To list transfers

```typescript
import { Transfer_OrderBy, OrderDirection } from 'hop-subgraph-client'
// List transfers
const { transfers } = await client.Transfers({
  first: 2,
  orderBy: Transfer_OrderBy.Value,
  orderDirection: OrderDirection.Desc,
})
```

#### To list tokens and TVL

```typescript
const { tokens } = await client.Tokens()
const { tvls } = await client.Tvls()
console.log('tokens :>> ', tokens)
console.log('tvls :>> ', tvls)
```

More examples are [here](./examples/)

## üîßContributing

Created an `.env` file with a env variable:

```bash
# https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/hop-protocol/hop-<mainnet, optimism...>
SUBGRAPH_URL=<HOP_SUBGRAPH_URL>
```

For local developement you can run

```bash
yarn dev
```

For production build:

```bash
yarn build
```

Which will generate a production build on "dist" folder.

To run tests type:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Adding new queries

Refer to any existing query in the `graphql` directory as a reference when first getting started.

1. Add the query to an existing `.graphql` file or create a new one in the `graphql` directory.
2. Run `yarn gen:subgraph`
3. Access the query from the generated client using `client.QueryName`

All queries get exactly typed, so if you query a partial reference to an underlying model, only the quereied fields will be available. If you need to reference the type created by the query, create a fragment and use that fragment in your query.

```graphql
fragment SubgraphBlock on Block {
  id
  author
  gasLimit
  difficulty
  gasUsed
  hash
  number
  parentHash
  receiptsRoot
  size
  timestamp
  transactionsRoot
  unclesHash
  totalDifficulty
  stateRoot
}

query Block($id: ID!, $block: Block_height) {
  block(id: $id) {
    ...SubgraphBlock
  }
}
```

The generated type will be exported from the module suffixed with `Fragment`. So in this example, your type is named: `SubgraphBlockFragment`.

```ts
import { SubgraphBlockFragment, Block_OrderBy } from 'hop-subgraph-client'

// List blocks
const { blocks } = await client.Blocks({
  first: 5,
  block: { number_gte: blockHeight },
  orderBy: Block_OrderBy.Timestamp,
})

const block: SubgraphMarketFragment = blocks[0]
```

## Resync the schema

Anytime there are schema changes published to `hop-mainnet-subgraph`, you'll need to resync the local schema by running `yarn gen:subgraph`.

If the update introduced breaking changes, running `yarn gen:subgraph` will fail and print the necessary changes that need to be made to the console.
